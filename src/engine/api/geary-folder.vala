/**
 * A Folder represents the basic unit of organization for email.
 *
 * Each {@link Account} provides a hierarchical listing of Folders.
 * Note that while most folders are able to store email messages, some
 * folders may not and may exist purely to group together folders
 * below it in the account's folder hierarchy. Folders that can
 * contain email messages either store these messages purely locally
 * (for example, in the case of an ''outbox'' for mail queued for
 * sending), or as a representation of those found in a mailbox on a
 * remote mail server, such as those provided by an IMAP server. Email
 * messages are represented by the {@link Email} class, and many
 * folder methods will return collections of these. For folders that
 * represent a remote mailbox, the mailbox's email are cached locally,
 * and the set of cached messages may be a subset of those available
 * in the mailbox, depending on an account's settings. Email messages
 * may be partially cached, in the case of a new message having just
 * arrived or a message with many large attachments that was not
 * completely downloaded.
 *
 * Folder objects must be opened (with {@link open_async} before using
 * most of its methods and should be closed with {@link close_async}
 * when completed, even if a previous method call has failed with an
 * IOError. Folders offer various open states indicating when its
 * "local" (disk or database) connection and "remote" (network)
 * connections are ready.  Generally the local connection opens first
 * and the remote connection takes time to establish. When in this
 * state, Folder's methods still operate, but will only return locally
 * stored information.
 *
 * The set of locally stored messages is called the folder's
 * ''vector'', and contains generally the most recent message in the
 * mailbox at the upper end, back through to some older message at the
 * start or lower end of the vector. Thus the ordering of the vector
 * is the ''natural'' ordering, based on the order in which messages
 * were appended to the folder, not when messages were sent or some
 * other criteria. For remote-backed folders, the engine will maintain
 * the vector in accordance with the value of {@link
 * AccountInformation.prefetch_period_days}, however the start of the
 * vector will be extended back past that over time and in response to
 * certain operations that cause the vector to be ''expanded'' ---
 * that is for additional messages to be loaded from the remote
 * server, extending the vector. The upper end of the vector is
 * similarly extended as new messages are appended to the folder by
 * another on the server or in response to user operations such as
 * moving a message.
 *
 * This class only offers a small selection of guaranteed
 * functionality (in particular, the ability to list its {@link
 * Email}).  Additional functionality for Folders is indicated by the
 * presence of {@link FolderSupport} interfaces, include {@link
 * FolderSupport.Remove}, {@link FolderSupport.Copy}, and so forth.

     * connection to a particular state, opening a file or database,
     * and so on. In general, a Folder's local store should open
     * immediately, hence if this call returns with error, {@link

     *
     * For folders that are backed by a remote mailbox, it may take
     * time for a remote connection to be established (if ever), and
     * so it is possible for this method to complete even though a
     * remote connection is not available. In this case the folder's
     * state and the email messages the its contains are backed by a
     * local cache, and may not reflect the full state of the remote
     * mailbox. Hence both folder and email state may subsequently be
     * changed (such as their position) after the remote connection
     * has been established and the local and remote stores have been
     * synchronised. Use signals such as {@link email_appended} to be
     * notified of such changes.
     *
     * Connecting to the {@link opened} signal can be used to be
     * notified when a remote connection has been established. Making
     * a method call on a folder that requires accessing the remote
     * mailbox before {@link OpenState.REMOTE} has been sent via this
     * signal will result in that call blocking until the remote is
     * open, the folder closes, or an error occurs. However it is also
     * possible for some methods to return early without waiting,
     * depending on prior information of the folder. See {@link
     * list_email_by_id_async} for special notes on its
     * operation.
     *
     * In some cases, establishing a remote connection may be
     * performed lazily, that is only when first needed. If however
     * {@link OpenFlags.NO_DELAY} is passed as an argument it will
     * instead force an immediate opening of the remote
     * connection. This still will not occur in the context of the
     * this method all call, but it will ensure the a connection is
     * initiated immediately. Since establishing remote connections is
     * costly, use this only when it's known that remote calls or
     * remote notifications to the Folder are imminent or monitoring
     * the Folder is vital (such as with the Inbox).
     *
     * If the Folder has been opened by a call to this method
     * previously, an internal open count is incremented and the
     * method returns. There are no other side-effects. This means
     * it's possible for the open_flags parameter to be ignored. See
     * the returned result for more information.
     *
     * A Folder may safely be reopened after it has been closed. This
     * allows for Folder objects to be emitted by the Account object
     * cheaply, but the client should only have a few open at a time,
     * as each may represent an expensive resource (such as a network
     * connection).
     *
     * If there is an error while opening, "open-failed" will be
     * fired.  (See that signal for more information on how many times
     * it may fire, and when.)  To prevent the Folder from going into
     * a halfway state, it will immediately schedule a close_async()
     * to cleanup, and those associated signals will be fired as well.

     * List a number of contiguous emails in the folder's vector.
     *
     * Emails in the folder are listed starting at a particular
     * location within the vector and moving either direction along
     * it. For remote-backed folders, the remote server is contacted
     * if any messages stored locally do not meet the requirements
     * given by `required_fields`, or if `count` extends back past the
     * low end of the vector.
     *
     * If the {@link EmailIdentifier} is null, it indicates the end of
     * the vector, not the end of the remote.  Which end depends on
     * the {@link ListFlags.OLDEST_TO_NEWEST} flag.  If not set, the
     * default is to traverse from newest to oldest, with null being
     * the newest email in the vector. If set, the direction is
     * reversed and null indicates the oldest email in the vector, not
     * the oldest in the mailbox.
     *
     * If not null, the EmailIdentifier ''must'' have originated from
     * this Folder.
     *
     * To fetch all available messages in one call, use a count of
     * `int.MAX`. If the {@link ListFlags.OLDEST_TO_NEWEST} flag is
     * set then the listing will contain all messages in the vector,
     * and no expansion will be performed. It may still access the
     * remote however in case of any of the messages not meeting the
     * given `required_fields`. If {@link ListFlags.OLDEST_TO_NEWEST}
     * is not set, the call will cause the vector to be fully expanded
     * and the listing will return all messages in the remote
     * mailbox. Note that specifying `int.MAX` in either case may be a
     * expensive operation (in terms of both computation and memory)
     * if the number of messages in the folder or mailbox is large,
     * hence should be avoided if possible.
     *
     * Use {@link ListFlags.INCLUDING_ID} to include the {@link Email}
     * for the particular identifier in the results.  Otherwise, the
     * specified email will not be included.  A null EmailIdentifier
     * implies that the top most email is included in the result (i.e.
     * ListFlags.INCLUDING_ID is not required);
     *
     * If the remote connection fails, this call will return
     * locally-available Email without error.
     *
     * There's no guarantee of the returned messages' order.

     * The Folder must be opened prior to attempting this operation.
