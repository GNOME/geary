 * Special local {@link Folder} used to query and display search results of {@link Email} from
 * across the {@link Account}'s local storage.
 *
 * SearchFolder is merely specified to be a Folder, but implementations may add various
 * {@link FolderSupport} interfaces.  In particular {@link FolderSupport.Remove} should be supported,
 * but again, is not required.
 *
 * SearchFolder is expected to produce {@link EmailIdentifier}s which can be accepted by other
 * Folders within the Account (with the exception of the Outbox).  Those Folders may need to
 * translate those EmailIdentifiers to their own type for ordering reasons, but in general the
 * expectation is that the results of SearchFolder can then be applied to operations on Email in
 * other remote-backed folders.
