/**
 * Credentials represent a username and a password authenticating a user for access to a resource.
 * More sophisticated schemes exist; this suffices for now.
 *
 * Either property (user, pass) may be null.  This indicates the Credentials are incomplete and
 * need further information (i.e. prompt user for username, fetch password from keyring, etc.)
 * Either field may be a non-null zero-length string; this is considered valid and is_complete()
 * will return true in this case.
 *
 * Note that Geary will hold Credentials in memory for the long-term, usually the duration of the
 * application.  This is because network resources often have to be connected (or reconnected) to
 * in the background and asking the user to reauthenticate each time is deemed inconvenient.
