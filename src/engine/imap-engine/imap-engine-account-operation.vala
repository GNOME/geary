/**
 * A unit of work to be executed by {@link GenericAccount}.
 *
 * It is important that account operations are idempotent in that they
 * can be safely re-executed multiple times, and perform the same task
 * each time. This means that in practice instance properties should
 * only be used to store state passed to the operation via its
 * constructor (e.g. a target folder to be updated) and this state
 * should not be modified when the operation is executed (e.g. the
 * target folder should not be changed or set to `null` during or
 * after execution), any state needed to be maintained when executing
 * should be passed as arguments to internal methods (e.g. the list of
 * messages to be checked in the target folder should be passed around
 * as arguments), and the operation should perform any needed sanity
 * checks before proceeding (e.g. check the target folder sill exists
 * before updating it).
 *
 * To queue an operation for execution, pass an instance to {@link
 * GenericAccount.queue_operation} after the account has been
 * opened. It will added to the accounts queue and executed
 * asynchronously when it reaches the front.
 *
 * Execution of the operation is managed by {@link
 * AccountProcessor}. Since the processor will not en-queue duplicate
 * operations, implementations of this class may override the {@link
 * equal_to} method to specify which instances are considered to be
 * duplicates.
