/**
 * Manage saving, replacing, and deleting the various versions of a draft message while the user is
 * editing it.
 *
 * Each composer should create a single DraftManager object for the lifetime of the compose
 * session.  The DraftManager interface offers "fire-and-forget" nonblocking (but not
 * asynchronous) methods for the composer to schedule remote operations without worrying about
 * synchronization, operation ordering, error-handling, and so forth.
 *
 * If successive drafts are submitted for storage, drafts waiting in the queue (i.e. not yet sent
 * to the server) are dropped without further consideration.  This prevents needless I/O with the
 * server saving drafts that are only to be replaced by later versions.
 *
 * Important: This object should be used ''per'' composed email and not to manage multiple emails
 * being composed to the same {@link Account}.  DraftManager's internal state is solely for managing
 * the lifecycle of a single email being composed by the user.
 *
 * The only async calls for DraftManager is {@link open_async} and {@link close_async}, which give
 * it a chance to initialize and tear-down in an orderly manner.
