/**
 * A SQLite database with a versioned, upgradeable schema.
 *
 * This class uses the SQLite user version pragma to track the current
 * version of a database, and a set of SQL scripts (one per version)
 * to manage updating from one version to another. When the database
 * is first opened by a call to {@link open}, its current version is
 * checked against the set of available scripts, and each available
 * version script above the current version is applied in
 * order. Derived classes may override the {@link pre_upgrade} and
 * {@link post_upgrade} methods to perform additional work before and
 * after an upgrade script is executed, and {@link starting_upgrade}
 * and {@link completed_upgrade} to be notified of the upgrade process
 * starting and finishing.
