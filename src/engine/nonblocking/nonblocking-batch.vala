/**
 * Allows for multiple asynchronous tasks to be executed in parallel and for their results to be
 * examined after all have completed.
 *
 * Nonblocking.Batch is designed specifically with Vala's async keyword in mind.
 * Although the yield keyword allows for async tasks to execute, it only allows them to performed
 * in serial.  In a loop, for example, the next task in the loop won't execute until the current
 * one has completed.  The thread of execution won't block waiting for it, but this can be
 * suboptiminal and certain cases.
 *
 * Nonblocking.Batch allows for multiple async tasks to be gathered (via the {@link add} method)
 * into a single batch.  Each task must subclass from {@link BatchOperation}.  It's expected that
 * the subclass will maintain state particular to the operation, although Nonblocking.Batch does
 * gather two types of a results the task may generate: a result object (which descends from Object)
 * or a thrown exception.  Other results should be stored by the subclass.
 *
 * To use, create a Nonblocking.Batch and populate it via the add() method.  When all
 * {@link BatchOperation}s have been added, call {@link execute_all_async}.  NonblockingBatch will
 * execute all BatchOperations at once and only complete their execute_all_async when all have
 * finished.  As mentioned earlier, it's also gather their returned objects and thrown exceptions
 * while they run.  See {@link get_result} and {@link throw_first_exception} for more information.
 *
 * The caller will want to call either get_result or throw_first_exception to ensure that
 * errors are propagated.  It's not necessary to call both.
 *
 * After execute_all_async has completed, the results may be examined.  The Nonblocking.Batch
 * object can ''not'' be reused.
 *
 * Nonblocking.Batch will fire off all operations at once and let them complete.  It does
 * not attempt to stop the others if one throws exception.  Also, there's no algorithm to submit the
 * operations in smaller chunks (to avoid flooding the thread's MainLoop).  These may be added in
 * the future.
