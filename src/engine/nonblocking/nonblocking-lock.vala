/**
 * A generic asynchronous lock data type.
 *
 * This class provides an asynchronous, queue-based lock
 * implementation to allow implementing safe access to resources that
 * are shared by asynchronous tasks. An asynchronous task may call
 * {@link wait_async} to wait for the lock to be marked as safe to
 * pass. Another asynchronous task may call {@link notify} to mark the
 * lock as being safe, notifying waiting tasks. Once marked as being
 * safe to pass, a lock may be reset to being unsafe by calling {@link
 * reset}.
 *
 * See the specialised sub-classes for concrete implementations,
 * which vary based on two features:
 *
 * //Broadcasting//: Whether all waiting tasks are notified when the
 * lock may be passed, or just the next earliest waiting task.
 *
 * //Autoreset//: Whether the lock is automatically reset after
 * notifying all waiting tasks, or if it must be manually reset by
 * calling {@link reset}.
 *
 * This class is ''not'' thread safe and should only be used by
 * asynchronous tasks.
