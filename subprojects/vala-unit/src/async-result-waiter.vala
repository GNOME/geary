/**
 * Allows non-async code to wait for async calls to be completed.
 *
 * To use instances of this class, call an async function or method
 * using the `begin()` form, passing {@link async_completion} as
 * completion argument (that is, the last argument):
 *
 * {{{
 *     var waiter = new AsyncResultWaiter();
 *     my_async_call.begin("foo", waiter.async_completion);
 * }}}
 *
 * Then, when you want to ensure the call is complete, pass the result
 * of calling {@link async_result} to its `end()` form:
 *
 * {{{
 *     my_async_call.end(waiter.async_result());
 * }}}
 *
 * This will block until the async call has completed.
 *
 * Note that {@link TestCase} exposes the same interface, so it is
 * usually easier to just call those when testing a single async call,
 * or multiple, non-interleaved async calls.
 *
 * This class is implemented as a FIFO queue of {@link
 * GLib.AsyncResult} instances, and thus can be used for waiting for
 * multiple calls. Note however the ordering depends on the order in
 * which the async calls being invoked are executed and are
 * completed. Thus if testing multiple interleaved async calls, you
 * should probably use an instance of this class per call.
