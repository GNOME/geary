	<title>Adding accounts</title>
	
	<p>The first time you start Geary, you will be prompted to add an email account.  On this screen,
	select if your account is Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook.com, or other.  For other account types, you will
	need to enter your IMAP and SMTP login settings manually.</p>
	
	<p>Additional accounts can be added from the Accounts dialog.  The <gui>Accounts</gui> option is
	available in either Geary's application menu or the gear menu in the upper-right of the
	toolbar.  (The location depends on the install desktop shell.  For GNOME Shell and Unity, the
	application menu is available near the top-left corner of the screen.)  Alternately,
	<keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>M</key></keyseq> will open the Accounts
	dialog.  To add an account, click the + button.</p>

	<section>
	<title>Editing existing accounts</title>
	
	<p>From the Accounts dialog, select an account and click the pencil icon to change various settings.
	Please note that Geary cannot change server settings on an existing account.  If you need to
	change your IMAP or SMTP server, you will need to delete the account and re-add it.</p>
	
	<p>To change the order that accounts are displayed in the folder list, drag the accounts in the
	Accounts dialog to the desired order.</p>
	
	<p>There are some advanced options available when editing accounts:</p>
	<list>
	<item><p>The <gui>Save sent mail</gui> checkbox controls whether Geary will push successfully sent
	messages up to the account's <gui>Sent Mail</gui> folder.  For Gmail accounts, this happens
	automatically.  Yahoo and some other accounts can be configured to do this automatically as well.
	For other accounts, if you disable this setting, you may be unable to view messages you've
	sent.</p></item>
	
	<item><p>The <gui>Sign emails</gui> checkbox indicates whether a signature will be automatically
	inserted when a composer is opened.  You may enter the signature into the box immediately
	below.  You may use HTML tags to style the text.  Switch to a preview of the signature using the
	buttons to the right.</p>
	
	<p>If you leave the signature in the Accounts dialog blank, Geary will use the
	<file>.signature</file> file in your home directory, if it exists.  This file may contain either
	plain text or HTML markup.  In the latter case, the markup will be inserted directly into the
	composer, without any escaping.</p></item>
	
	<item><p>The <gui>Download mail</gui> drop-down allows you to configure how much mail Geary will keep
	locally.  Geary can only use locally available mail when searching and forming
	conversations.</p></item>
	</list>

	<section>
	<title>Removing accounts</title>
	
	<p>To delete an account, open the Accounts dialog, select the account, and press the - button.
	Geary will delete all information associated with the account.</p>
