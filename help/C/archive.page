  <title>Archive, trash and delete messages</title>

  <p>Geary lets you archive messages if your server supports
  it. Clicking the <gui style="button">Archive</gui> toolbar button
  moves the conversation from the current folder to the
  <gui>Archive</gui> folder for most email services, or to <gui>All
  Mail</gui> for GMail. Archiving helps keep your email organised by
  moving old and replied-to email out of the way.</p>

  <p>To move conversations to the <gui>Trash</gui> folder, select them
  and click the <gui style="button">Trash</gui> toolbar button. To
  permanently delete conversations, hold down <key>Shift</key> and
  click the <gui style="button">Delete</gui> button that appears in
  place of the <gui>Trash</gui> button, or open the conversation in
  the <gui>Trash</gui> folder and click <gui
  style="button">Delete</gui> there.</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <title>Undoing changes</title>
    <p>Note that you can always undo archiving or trashing a message
    if you change your mind. Click <gui style="button">Undo</gui> on
    the pop-up notification that appears, or type
    <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Z</key></keyseq>, or open the folder,
    find the message, then move it back to your <gui>Inbox</gui></p>
  </note>

  <p>While both <gui style="button">Archive</gui> and <gui
  style="button">Trash</gui> removes conversations from your
  <gui>Inbox</gui> folder, there is an important difference. Clicking
  <gui style="button">Archive</gui> will ensure your conversations are
  kept so you can find them again later. Clicking <gui
  style="button">Trash</gui> will cause conversations to be hidden
  from <link xref="search"/>, and they will likely be deleted in the
  future.</p>
