  <section id="overview">
    <title>Composing and replying</title>

    <p>To start a new email conversation, click the <gui
    style="button">Compose</gui> button on the toolbar. Type the email
    address of the people to receive the message in the <gui
    style="input">To</gui> text field, and a subject line in the <gui
    style="input">Subject</gui> field. You can then type your message
    in the text area below these. Once the message is ready to send,
    click <gui style="button">Send</gui> or type
    <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Enter</key></keyseq> to send the
    message.</p>

    <note style="tip">
      <title>Undoing sending</title>
      <p>When sending an email, Geary will wait 5 seconds before
      delivering the message. During this time, you will be able to
      click <gui style="button">Undo</gui> on the pop-up notification
      that appears or type
      <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Z</key></keyseq> to re-open the
      email, and make more changes to it.</p>
    </note>

    <p>When entering an email address in the <gui
    style="input">To</gui> and <gui style="input">Cc</gui> fields,
    Geary will provide suggestions from your desktop address book and
    from previously sent and received email messages. To choose one of
    these suggestions, simply click on it. In addition, <gui
    style="input">Bcc</gui> and <gui style="input">Reply-to</gui>
    fields can be shown by selecting <gui style="menu">Show extended
    fields</gui> from the formatting toolbar menu.</p>

    <p>To reply to the currently selected conversation, click one of
    the <gui style="button">Reply</gui>, <gui style="button">Reply
    All</gui> or <gui style="button">Forward</gui> toolbar
    buttons. This will open a new reply or forwarded email composer
    for the latest message in the conversation.</p>

    <p>When replying, the message being replied to will be quoted and
    copied into the footer of the new reply. This can be deleted
    before typing a reply by pressing
    <key>Backspace</key>. Alternatively, text can be selectively
    quoted by selecting the desired text in a message and clicking
    <gui style="button">Reply</gui> or <gui style="button">Reply
    All</gui>, only the selected text will be quoted.</p>

    <p>To reply to a specific email message, open the message menu in the
    top corner of the message and choose <gui>Reply</gui>, <gui>Reply
    All</gui> or <gui>Forward</gui>.</p>

  <section id="features">
    <title>Text formatting, images and attachments</title>

    <p>Geary's email composer lets you use text styles such as
    <em>bold</em> and <em>italic</em>, indent text to quote it and
    links to web pages. Simply select the text and click the
    appropriate button on the formatting toolbar.</p>

    clicking the <gui style="button">Bulleted list</gui> and <gui
    style="button">Numbered list</gui> buttons on the formatting
    toolbar. The level of indentation of list items can be adjusted

    style="button">Un-indent</gui> formatting toolbar buttons.</p>

    <p>Images can be inserted into rich text messages by clicking the
    <gui style="button">Insert Image</gui> button on the formatting
    toolbar and selecting the image to attach, by dragging an image
    from the <gui>Files</gui> application into the email body and then
    dropping it, or by pasting an image that has been copied to the
    clipboard from another application.</p>

    <p>Documents, music, videos, and other files can be attached to
    the email by clicking the <gui style="button">Attach File</gui>
    button at the top of the composer window and selecting the
    document to attach, or by dragging a file from the
    <gui>Files</gui> application to the composer window, and dropping

  </section>

  <section id="spellcheck">
    <title>Checking spelling</title>

    <p>Geary supports spell-checking your composed email in one or
    more languages, as you type. To enable spell-checking, first
    ensure your computer has spell-check dictionaries installed for
    the desired languages. Consult your computer's help to determine
    how to install dictionaries if not present.</p>

    <p>To select languages for spell-checking, click the <gui
    style="button">Spell check</gui> button on the formatting toolbar,
    and the language selection popover will appear. Click on a
    language in the list to toggle it on or off, and click the <gui
    style="button">-</gui> button to remove it from the list. If a
    language does not appear in the list, search for it by typing its
    name in the search box, then click the <gui style="button">+</gui>
    button to add it.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="drafts">
    <title>Saving drafts and restoring discarded messages</title>

    <p>For mail servers that support drafts, Geary will automatically
    save the message as you type on the server after a short
    delay.</p>

    <p>To edit an existing draft, select the <gui>Drafts</gui> folder
    in the folder list, select the message, and click "Edit Draft" in
    the conversation viewer.</p>

    <p>Geary will delete the draft when you send the message.</p>

    <note style="tip">
      <p>If you save or discard a composed email, you can re-open it
      by clicking <gui style="button">Undo</gui> on the pop-up
      notification that appears or by typing
      <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Z</key></keyseq>. The ability to
      restore a saved or discarded composer will be remain for up to
      30 minutes. After that you will need to re-open the message via
      the <gui>Drafts</gui> folder, if present.</p>
    </note>
  </section>

  <section id="plain-text">
    <title>Plain text messages</title>

    <p>Geary can also send plain text messages. In the drop-down menu,
    check or uncheck <gui style="menu">Rich Text</gui> to toggle
    between plain text and rich text mode. Plain text mode is useful
    when sending email to mailing lists that prohibit rich text (HTML)
    messages, or when sending email to people that do no use modern
    clients like Geary.</p>

    <p>In plain text mode, text will be automatically wrapped using
    soft line breaks so that it is no longer than 74 characters wide,
    and indented text will be wrapped and quoted using a “>” character
    for each level of quoting.</p>
