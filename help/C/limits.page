    <p>Geary is still in early development. Geary supports IMAP and has been tested with Gmail, Yahoo and the free Dovecot mail server. Geary may not yet work well with other IMAP servers.  Additionally, Geary is still missing search and numerous other features.</p>
    
    <p>To learn more about the features we're working on and the future of Geary, please visit Geary's <link href="http://redmine.yorba.org/projects/geary/wiki">Redmine page</link>.</p>
