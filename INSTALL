    Building & Installing Geary
    ---------------------------

  * Building

    To build Geary, run the following commands:

        $ ./configure
        $ make

    By default, Geary will install under /usr/local.  The configure script can
    customize the prefix directory.  Run ./configure --help for instructions
    and other installation options.


  * Dependencies

    Building Geary requires at least the following major libraries:

      * GTK+ version 3.14
      * WebKitGTK+ 2.10
      * Vala 0.26

    With a full GObject introspection repository, cmake,
    desktop-file-validate, and xml2po. Vala's vapigen must be
    installed as well.

    See the file `src/CMakeLists.txt` for the complete list of minimum
    version requirements.

    Geary also requires SQLite to be built with the compiler flag
    `-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3`. Further, SQLite 3.11.x specifically must
    also be built with `-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_TOKENIZER`. Most
    distribution's packages meet these requirements, however Fedora 24
    users and others may be required to rebuild SQLite 3.11 with the
    second flag, or install SQLite 3.12 and recompile Geary.

    The developer packages and headers for the following libraries are also
    required when building Geary:

      * canberra
      * gee-0.8
      * gio-2.0
      * glib-2.0
      * gmime-2.6
      * gtk+-3.0
      * libsecret-1
      * libxml-2.0
      * notify
      * sqlite3
      * webkit2gtk-4.0
      * gcr-3
      * enchant
      * messaging-menu (optional; enables support for Ubuntu Unity messaging
        menu)
      * unity (optional; enables support for Ubuntu Unity launcher)

    Most of these are standard libraries available from major distros' package
    repositories.


  * Installing dependencies on Fedora

    Fedora 23 and later ships with the correct versions of the
    required libraries. Install them by running this command:

        $ sudo yum install vala gobject-introspection-devel cmake \
            desktop-file-utils gnome-doc-utils libcanberra-devel libgee-devel \
            glib2-devel gmime-devel gtk3-devel libnotify-devel sqlite-devel \
            webkitgtk4-devel libsecret-devel libxml2-devel vala-tools \
            gcr-devel enchant-devel


  * Installing dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian

    Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) and later ships with the correct
    versions of the required libraries.

    Debian 8 (Jessie) requires stable backports enabled for
    WebKitGTK. See <https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/> for
    more information about using stable backports. Later versions
    ships with the correct versions of the required libraries.

    Install them by running this command:

        $ sudo apt-get install valac libgirepository1.0-dev \
            cmake desktop-file-utils gnome-doc-utils libcanberra-dev \
            libgee-0.8-dev libglib2.0-dev libgmime-2.6-dev libgtk-3-dev \
            libsecret-1-dev libxml2-dev libnotify-dev libsqlite3-dev \
            libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgcr-3-dev libenchant-dev

    And for Ubuntu Unity integration:

        $ sudo apt-get install libunity-dev libmessaging-menu-dev

    Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty) does not have all the dependencies to
    build this version Geary. Consier using the Geary 0.11 LTS series
    instead.


  * Running

    If you wish to try Geary before installing it, you may execute it directly
    from its build directory:

        $ ./geary

    Note that certain desktop integration (such as being listed in an
    application menu) requires full installation.


  * Installing

    After Geary has built, run the following command to install it:

        $ sudo make install

    To uninstall, run:

        $ sudo make uninstall
