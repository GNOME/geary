    Building & Installing Geary
    ---------------------------

  * Building

    To build Geary, run the following commands:

        $ ./configure
        $ make

    By default, Geary will install under /usr/local.  The configure script can
    customize the prefix directory.  Run ./configure --help for instructions
    and other installation options.


  * Dependencies

    Building Geary requires Vala 0.22.1 or higher with a full GObject
    introspection repository, intltool, cmake, desktop-file-validate, and
    xml2po.  Vala's vapigen must be installed as well.

    The developer packages and headers for the following libraries are also
    required when building Geary:

      * canberra
      * gee-0.8
      * gio-2.0
      * glib-2.0
      * gmime-2.6
      * gtk+-3.0
      * libsecret-1
      * libxml-2.0
      * notify
      * sqlite3
      * webkitgtk-3.0
      * messaging-menu (optional; enables support for Ubuntu Unity messaging
        menu)
      * unity (optional; enables support for Ubuntu Unity launcher)

    Most of these are standard libraries available from major distros' package
    repositories.

    Geary requires WebKitGTK-3 1.10 or higher.  However, it will not build with
    WebKitGTK-3 versions 2.1.1 to 2.1.90.0.  See
    <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=713168> for details.


  * Installing dependencies on Fedora

    Fedora 20 ships with the correct version of Vala.  Install it by running
    this command:

        $ sudo yum install vala

    In Fedora versions prior to 20, you must install Vala from source.
    Download and install the tarball from
    <https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Release>.

    You can install the rest of the build dependencies for Geary in any version
    of Fedora by running this command:

        $ sudo yum install gobject-introspection-devel intltool cmake \
            desktop-file-utils gnome-doc-utils libcanberra-devel libgee-devel \
            glib2-devel gmime-devel gtk3-devel libnotify-devel sqlite-devel \
            unique3-devel webkitgtk3-devel libsecret-devel libxml2-devel \
            vala-tools


  * Installing dependencies on Ubuntu

    Ubuntu 14.04 ships the correct version of Vala.  In Ubuntu versions prior
    to 14.04, you must add the Vala PPA first by running these commands:

        $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vala-team/ppa
        $ sudo apt-get update

    You can install the build dependencies for Geary in Ubuntu by running this
    command:

        $ sudo apt-get install valac-0.20 libgirepository1.0-dev intltool \
            cmake desktop-file-utils gnome-doc-utils libcanberra-dev \
            libgee-0.8-dev libglib2.0-dev libgmime-2.6-dev libgtk-3-dev \
            libsecret-1-dev libxml2-dev libnotify-dev libsqlite3-dev \
            libunique-3.0-dev libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev libmessaging-menu-dev \
            libunity-dev

    You should check that you are using the right version of valac by running:

        $ valac --version
        Vala 0.22.1

    If it reports anything less than 0.22.1, select the correct version when
    running:

        $ sudo update-alternatives --config valac

    Note that Ubuntu 12.04 does not have all the dependencies to build Geary.
    See <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary/BuildingOnUbuntu12.04> for details
    and instructions.


  * Running

    If you wish to try Geary before installing it, you may execute it directly
    from its build directory:

        $ ./geary

    Note that certain desktop integration (such as being listed in an
    application menu) requires full installation.


  * Installing

    After Geary has built, run the following command to install it:

        $ sudo make install

    To uninstall, run:

        $ sudo make uninstall
