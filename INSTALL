    Building & Installing Geary
    ---------------------------

  * Building

    To build Geary, run the following commands:

        $ ./configure
        $ make

    By default, Geary will install under /usr/local.  The configure script can
    customize the prefix directory.  Run ./configure --help for instructions
    and other installation options.


  * Dependencies

    Building Geary requires the following major libraries and tools:

      * GTK+ 3.22
      * WebKitGTK+ 2.16
      * Vala 0.34
      * GObject introspection repository

    Geary also requires SQLite to be built with the compiler flag
    `-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3`. Further, SQLite 3.11.x specifically must
    also be built with `-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_TOKENIZER`.

    The developer packages and headers for the following libraries and
    tools are required when building Geary:

      * canberra
      * cmake
      * desktop-file-utils
      * gee-0.8
      * gio-2.0
      * glib-2.0
      * gmime-2.6
      * gnome-doc-utils
      * gtk+-3.0
      * libsecret-1
      * libxml-2.0
      * notify
      * sqlite3
      * webkit2gtk-4.0
      * gcr-3
      * enchant
      * messaging-menu (optional; enables support for Ubuntu Unity
        messaging menu)
      * unity (optional; enables support for Ubuntu Unity launcher)

    Most of these are standard libraries available from major distros'
    package repositories.

    See the files `CMakeLists.txt` and `src/CMakeLists.txt` for the
    complete list of required libraries, tools and minimum version
    requirements.


  * Installing dependencies on Fedora

    Fedora 25 and later ships with the correct versions of the
    required libraries. Install them by running this command:

        $ sudo yum install vala gobject-introspection-devel cmake \
            desktop-file-utils gnome-doc-utils libcanberra-devel libgee-devel \
            glib2-devel gmime-devel gtk3-devel libnotify-devel sqlite-devel \
            webkitgtk4-devel libsecret-devel libxml2-devel vala-tools \
            gcr-devel enchant-devel


  * Installing dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian

    Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty) and later ships with the correct versions of
    the required libraries. Note that Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) does not
    meet the minimum requirements, users of that are encourage to use
    Geary 0.12 LTS instead.

    Debian 9 (Stretch) and later ships with the correct versions of
    the required libraries.

    Install them by running this command:

        $ sudo apt-get install valac libgirepository1.0-dev \
            cmake desktop-file-utils gnome-doc-utils libcanberra-dev \
            libgee-0.8-dev libglib2.0-dev libgmime-2.6-dev libgtk-3-dev \
            libsecret-1-dev libxml2-dev libnotify-dev libsqlite3-dev \
            libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgcr-3-dev libenchant-dev

    And for Ubuntu Unity integration:

        $ sudo apt-get install libunity-dev libmessaging-menu-dev


  * Running

    If you wish to try Geary before installing it, you may execute it directly
    from its build directory:

        $ ./geary

    Note that certain desktop integration (such as being listed in an
    application menu) requires full installation.


  * Installing

    After Geary has built, run the following command to install it:

        $ sudo make install

    To uninstall, run:

        $ sudo make uninstall
